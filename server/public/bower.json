  "description": "The Geospatial Web of Things, is a project of the Institute for Geoinformatics Münster (Germany), which took place in summer term 2016. This `bower.json` belongs to Virtual Smart Things Group and focuses on the WebClient, which is the frontend-application for users, guests and an admin. A user can subscribe himself to an email-notification-system, which will be triggered on the main-server, if a sensor detectes a specific water level. The thresholds of the water levels are based on heights of cars, bikes, motorbikes and humans. The user can specify his own thresholds. A map shows the locations of the sensors at floodways and bridges. The application communicates via a REST-API with the main-server and can request and get realtime data via a Websocket-Connection.",
