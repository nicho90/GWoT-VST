<br>
<p>This project is part of the course The Geospatial Web of Things, which took place at the Institute for Geoinformatics, Münster in summer term 2016. 3 groups implemented different use-cases in different architectures (Vertical Integration, Virtual Smart Things, Physical Smart Things). This repository contains the work of the group with the Virtual Smart Things architecture.</p>

<p>Within this study project we implemented smart and mobile water gauges as first class citizens in the Web of Things. We dived into the IoT and WoT concepts, technologies and application patterns, and we learned to develop and integrated smart things into the socio technical environment of disaster management.</p>
