  "description": "The Geospatial Web of Things, is a project of the Institute for Geoinformatics Münster (Germany), which took place in summer term 2016. This `package.json` belongs to Virtual Smart Things Group and focuses on the Server, which is the main-part of the overall architecture. The Main-Server consits of a MQTT-Broker, which listens to published MQTT-messages from the Raspberry Pis, which collects water levels from sensors. Furthermore the in-comming sensor-data will be post-processed and stored in a database. A REST-API provides the data for the WebClient, which visualizes the data as timeseries and manages the sensor-settings and subscriptions. The Nodejs-Webserver consits of the static files for the WebClient, which are in the subfolder `/public`.",
